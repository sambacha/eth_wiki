- We need a bundle (cmake -DBUNDLE=) that includes all components and built options for the software release.

- We should have debug bots (PRs, develop) and release bots (master, develop?). The release ones should prepare installables (Windows Installer, debian packages, homebrew).
- 3 guys responsible for 3 OSs: Windows, OSX, Debian.
