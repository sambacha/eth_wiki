Workflow for implementing a new feature:

1. PT: Start story
1. Implement feature including tests
1. PT: Finish story
1. Github: Create pull request
1. Github: Create a link from the PT story if any to the pull request
1. Github: Wait for pull request to be merged
1. Explain the feature in [Solidity-Features](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Features)
1. Create links from the PT story to the features section and to the pull requests
1. PT: Deliver story
1. Ping the Product Owner to (hopefully) accept the story in PT
1. Wait for acceptance.
1. Potentially add documentation to [Solidity-Tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Tutorial)
