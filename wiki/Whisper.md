### Use case

* DApps that need to publish small amounts of information to each other and have the publication last some substantial amount of time. For example, a currency exchange DApp may use it to record an offer to sell some currency at a particular rate on an exchange. In this case, it may last anything between tens of minutes and days. The offer wouldn't be binding, merely a hint to get a potential deal started.

* DApps that need to signal to each other in order to ultimately collaborate on a transaction. For example, a currency exchange DApp may use it to coordinate an offer prior to creating one (or two, depending on how the exchange is structured) transactions on the exchange.

* DApps that need to provide non-real-time hinting or general communications between each other. E.g. a small chat-room app.

* DApps that need to provide dark (plausible denial over perfect network traffic analysis) comms to two correspondents that know nothing of each other but a hash. This could be a DApp for a whistleblower to communicate to a known journalist exchange some small amount of verifiable material and arrange between themselves for some other protocol (Swarm, perhaps) to handle the bulk transfer.

In general, think transactions, but without the eventual archival, any necessity of being bound to what is said or automated execution & state change.

### Specs

* **Low-level** API only exposed to DApps, never to users.
* **Low-bandwidth** Not designed for large data transfers.
* **Uncertain-latency** Not designed for RTC.
* **Dark** No reliable methods for tracing packets or 
* Typical usage:
  * Low-latency, 1-1 or 1-N signalling messages.
  * High latency, high TTL 1-* publication messages.

Messages less than 64K bytes, typically not much larger than 1K.

### Existing solutions

* UDP: Similar in API-level, native multicasting. No TTL, security or privacy safeguards.
* [0MQ](http://zeromq.org/): A distributed messaging system, no inherant privacy safeguards.
* [Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page): Similar in the basic approach of P2P network exchanging messages with baseline PKI for dark comms. Higher-level (e-mail replacement, only "several thousand/day", larger mails), fixed TTL and no hinting to optimise for throughput. Unclear incentivisation.
* [TeleHash](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/blob/master/network.md#paths): Secure connection-orientated RTC comms. Similar in approach to BitTorrent (uses modified Kademila tech), but rather than discovering peers for a given hash, it routes to the recipient given its hash. Uses DHT to do deterministic routing therefore insecure against simple statistical packet-analysis attacks against a large-scale attacker. Connection oriented, so no TTL and not designed for asynchronous data publication.
* [Tox](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/docs/updates/DHT.md): Higher-level (IM & AV chat) replacement.

### Basic Design

Uses the `"shh"` protocol string of ÐΞVP2P.

Rest coming soon, once I've finished prototyping. Gav.
